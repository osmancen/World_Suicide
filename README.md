# World_Suicide Rates
An analysis of WorldBank suicide dataset
## An overall summary of the analysis
- Total suicide numbers are above 110K in 1985 with a steady increase reaching to 250K in early 2000s with a slow decrease afterward but staying above 200K by 2015. 
- The average suicide number per year per country is between 200 and 280 giving about 16-25 people per 100K per country per year.  
- The suicide rate is 3-6 times larger in male population than in female population.
- The suicide rate increases with age and as generations get older. 
- The suicide rate is highest among the Eastern European and Russian Federation countries. 
- At overall level, there is not a good correlation between suicide rate and GDP. However, the high suicide rate is inversely correlated with low GDP mostly in countries with high suicide rate and low GDP. However, some countries are exception from this generalized comment, such as Guyana, Republic of Korea, and Suriname show an increased suicide rate with increased GDP. This observation indicates that there are other indicators that effect the rate of suicide in different countries.
